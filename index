    <h2 id="AJ">About Jeff</h2>
    <p>I am a student from South Korea, who went to a boarding school for 4 years in New Jersey. Comparatively, I am older than my peers because I went
        to the army, as required by my country. I wish I have graduated with my original class but it's okay. My current concentration at Babson is Accounting and 
        business analytics. Over the summer, I have worked at KPMG as an audit associate for commercial clients. I have also studied for the <a href="https://www.nasba.org" target="_blank">Uniform CPA exams</a> 
        not so long ago and was lucky enough to pass all four sections. I wish to further my knowledge and expertise in computer science and programming
        so that I could join the two fields for a fruitful future career.

      Recently, I took interest in indoors climbing, which during the summer I went around a lot of Boston's indoor bouldering gyms and climbed with
      friends. Also, I love going to the gym and weight lifting since its a great way to challenge myself to constantly grow. Other than physical hobbies,
      I also like reading books related to philosophy. I have been reading a lot of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius books, famous for their stoic mindsets
      and way of living. Furthermore, I like watching anime on my free time, which conveniently made me become fluent at Japanese gradually. To that, I 
      also love traveling around the world, immersing myself in different cultures and learning more about the bigger world.
