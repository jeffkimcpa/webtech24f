        What is the objective of your website?
    </h1>
    <p>
        The objective of this project will be to compile a travel guide for Japan that would
        consist of my personal reviews of unique locations, scenaries, museums, and restaurants.
        I will try to cover three or four big cities that have unique aspects. Having been to Japan
        a lot, I will try my best to tie my insight for a comprehensive review so that the website
        could actually help potential travelers have a better feel of what they should be expecting.

        The target audience for this website will be college travelers with a budget.

        What content do you plan to include in each page?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Apart from the Contact Us, About Me, Site Map, and Credits pages, I will create four
        "bigger" category separating them as big cities. It will be Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Sapporo.
        These four pages will also have three more subpages that will detail general information 
        about the city, eateries, and site-seeing locations. If time permits, I will try to include
        premade vlogs that I took in one of my Japna trips in the past.
