        <p>Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? 
        Do they just not worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorilla to read and study carefully 
        seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to know just what to do. They never worry about 
        spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about not having enough time with them. Now, don't get 
        me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet that 
        while gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of an elephant?)</p>
